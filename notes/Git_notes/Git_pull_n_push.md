Scenario! You have a **divergence situation** now, where:

1. You have local files (local git repo).
2. You pushed them to Azure DevOps remote repo.
3. Then you made some **direct changes on the remote repo** (using Azure DevOps UI).
4. Now your **local repo is outdated** and doesn’t have those remote changes.

---

## Goal:

You want to **sync your local repo with remote**, and also manage further changes properly.

---

## **Solution: Step-by-Step Git Commands**

---

### **1. Fetch Latest Changes from Remote**

```bash
git fetch origin
```

* This downloads the latest remote changes but does not merge them yet.

---

### **2. Merge Remote Branch into Local Branch**

```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

* This will pull remote changes into your local branch.
* If there are no conflicts, it will merge automatically.
* If conflicts arise, Git will show conflict markers for you to resolve.

---

### **3. (If Conflicts Occur) Resolve Conflicts**

* Open the conflicted files in VSCode or any editor.
* Look for markers like:

  ```diff
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  (your local changes)
  =======
  (remote repo changes)
  >>>>>>> origin/main
  ```
* Edit the file to fix the conflict.
* After resolving:

  ```bash
  git add <conflicted-file>
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
  ```

---

### **4. Continue with Your Local Changes (if any)**

Make new changes locally if required.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "New local changes after sync"
```

---

### **5. Push Your Local Changes Back to Remote**

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

---

### **Summary Flow of Commands**

```bash
git fetch origin
git pull origin main    # Or your branch name
# (Resolve conflicts if needed)
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved conflicts / added changes"
git push origin main
```

---

## **Optional: Safer Way — Using Rebase Instead of Merge**

If you want a **cleaner history (no merge commits)**:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
# Resolve conflicts (if any)
# After resolving:
git rebase --continue
git push origin main
```

---

## Visual Diagram of This Scenario:

```
Local Repo (outdated)
   |
git fetch / pull
   ↓
Merged Remote Changes into Local Repo
   |
Add New Local Changes (if any)
   |
git push back to Azure DevOps
```

# Commit Corruption Scenario

You uploaded files to a GitHub (ADO repo — I'm assuming you mean Azure DevOps Repos?), and you see the files in the repository, but when you open them, **the code content is not visible**.

This can happen due to a few common reasons:

---

### **Possible Causes & Fixes:**

### 1. **Empty Files Got Committed (Accidentally)**

* The files may have been created but never staged with content.
* **Check Locally:** Are the files in your local repo having content?

  ```bash
  cat <filename>
  ```
* If yes, then probably only empty files were committed.

**Solution:**

* Stage and commit the actual content.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Added actual file content"
  git push
  ```

---

### 2. **.gitignore Excluded Files**

* Files may exist locally but were ignored via `.gitignore`.
* **Check:** Does `.gitignore` contain patterns that exclude those files?

**Solution:**

* Remove or adjust `.gitignore` rules if needed.
* Force add ignored files:

  ```bash
  git add -f <filename>
  git commit -m "Force add file"
  git push
  ```

---

### 3. **Binary Files or Wrong Encoding**

* If files are binary (like `.exe`, `.dll`, `.zip`), GitHub/Azure DevOps won’t render code.
* Or files were saved with improper encoding (like UTF-16 with BOM).

**Solution:**

* Ensure files are in a **text-based format** and saved as UTF-8.
* Try opening them locally in a text editor (like VSCode or Notepad++) to confirm.

---

### 4. **Corrupt Commit or Partial Upload**

* If the git commit was interrupted or files weren’t uploaded completely, Git may show empty blobs.

**Solution:**

* Try re-committing:

  ```bash
  git pull --rebase
  git add .
  git commit -m "Fix file upload"
  git push
  ```

---

### 5. **Azure DevOps UI Rendering Issue**

* Rare, but sometimes ADO/GitHub UI has bugs not rendering files.
* Try:

  * Refreshing the page.
  * Viewing the **raw file**.
  * Cloning the repo freshly to see if the files are correct locally.

### Quick Debug Checklist:

| Step | Check                                          | Expected                     |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1    | Do files have content in local repo?           | Yes                          |
| 2    | Run `git status` — Are files staged/committed? | Clean working directory      |
| 3    | Check `.gitignore` rules                       | Files should not be excluded |
| 4    | Verify commit in Azure DevOps                  | Commit hash contains files   |
| 5    | Try viewing raw file in ADO                    | Content should display       |
